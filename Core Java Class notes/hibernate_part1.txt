Developing Data Access Layer using ORM approach:-
---------------------------------------------------------------

Java persistence:-
---------------------

--the process of saving/storing java objs state into the DB s/w is known as java persistence..

--for small application we can store business data (java object state ) in the files using IO streams (serialization and deserailization approach).

--the logic that write to store java objs(which is holding business data ) into the file using IO Streams is known as
 "IO stream based persistence logic".

--but in the realtime application, we store/save/persist the business data inside the database using JDBC

public String saveStudentDetails(Student student)

--the logic that we write to store java objs data into the DB using JDBC is known as "jdbc based persistence logic"


limitation of JDBC based persistence logic:-
----------------------------------------------------


1.jdbc can't store the java objs into the table directly,becoz sql queires does not allows the java objs as input, 
here we need to convert obj data into the simple(atmoic) value to store them in a DB.



2.jdbc code is the DB dependent code becoz it uses  DB s/w dependent queries. so our jdbc based persistence logic is not 100% portable across various DB s/w.


3.jdbc code having boiler plate code problem (writing the same code except sql queries in multiple classes of our application again and again)..

4.jdbc code throws lots of checked exceptions, programmer need to handle them.


5.After the select operation, we get the ResultSet object.this RS obj we can not 
transfer from one layer to another layer and to get the data from the ResultSet we need to now the structure of the ResultSet.

6.there is no any caching and transaction management support is available in jdbc.

etc ...


--to overcome the above limitations we need to use ORM approach.

ORM (Object - ralation mapping):-  Java---->   relation
============================
--the process of mapping java classes with the DB tables ,, java class member variables with the DB table columns and 
making the object of java class reperesents the DB table records having synchronization bt them is called a OR mapping.

Student object----------->row of the  student table 

-here synchronization bt obj and table row is nothing but, the modification done in the obj will reflect the DB table row and vise-versa.

***the logic that we write to store java objs into the DB using ORM approach is called as ORM based persistence logic.

--there are variaous ORM s/w are available in the market, these s/w will act as f/w software to perform ORM based persistence logic. 

ex:-

Hibernate 
Toplink
Ibatis,
etc...



f/w software :- 
----------------

--it is a special type of s/w that provides abstraction layer on one or more existing core technology to simplyfy the process of application development.

--in java most of  the f/w softwares comes in the form of jar files(one or more jar file)

--in order to use/work on these f/w softwares we need to add those jar files in our classpath.


--while working with the ORM based persistence logic we write all the logics in the form of objs without any sql quiery support.
 due to which our logic will become DB s/w independent logic.


--In ORM based logic, the ORM s/w takes objs as an input and gives objs as an output so no need to convert object data to the primitive values.


--ORM s/w addresses the mismatches bt object oriented representation of data and relational representation of data.




1.inheritence mismatches / IS-A mismatch

2.Granularity mismatch / has-A mismatch

3. assotiation mismatch / table relation mismatch 

i.e for processing and presenting the data, we represent the data in form of ObjectOriented fashion
whereas for storing the data we represnet the data in the form of relational fashion(in the tables)




class Student{

int roll,
String name,
int marks,
Address addr; (city,state,pin)

}

class Course{


}



student table :- 

roll int
name varchar
marks int 

course table :-




--one obj of Student class will represnt one row of student table

ORM s/w addresses these mismathces in very easy manner.




POJO class:-
---------------

Plain old java object

--it is a normal java class not bounded with any technology or f/w s/ws.
i.e a java class that is not implementing or extending technology/framework api related 
classes or interfaces.

--a java  class that can be compiled without adding any extra jar files in the classpath are known
as a POJO class.

POJI (plain old java interface )

Note:- every java bean class is a POJO but every POJO is not a  java bean.

public class X {

public X(int x){

}

} 

--above class is a POJO class but it is not a java bean class.



ORM s/w features:-
===============

1.it can persist/store java obj to the DB directly.

2.it supports POJO and POJI model

3.it is a lightweight s/w becoz to excute the ORM based application we need not install any kind of servers.

4.ORM persistance logic is DB independent. it is portable accross multiple DB s/ws.
(beocz here we deal with object, not with the sql queires)

5.prevent the developers from boiler plate code coding to perform CRUD operarions.

6.it generates fine tuned sql statements internally that improves the performance.

7.it provides caching mechanism (maintaing one local copy to inhance the performance)

8.it provides implicit connection pooling.

9.exception handling is optional becoz it throws unchecked exceptions.

10.it has a special Query language called JPQL (JPA query language ) that totally depends upon the '
objects.   select eid,ename from employee.


Hibernate and JPA:-
-----------------------

Hibernate:- it is one of the ORM based framework s/w.  other s/w are :- toplink,ibatis,etc..

JPA:- (Java persistence api) :- it is an open specification given by Oracle corp,  to develop any ORM based s/w .

JPA provides a standard api to work with any kind of ORM based s/w .

JPA api belongs from "javax.persistence" package.

--Hibernate is one of the most frequently used JPA implementation

--HB provides its own api to develop ORM based persistence logic , if we use those api then
our application will become vendor lock, ie we can not port our application accross multiple 
ORM s/w. 

--HB api comes in the form of "org.hibernate" package.


Note:- we get the JPA api , along with any ORM s/w , becoz all the ORM s/w implements 
JPA specification.

java.sql
javax.sql   this jdbc api comes along with jdk installation


Jpa with hibernate:-
-------------------------

JPA Application:-
---------------------

any java application, that uses JPA api to perform persistnce operation (CRUD ) operation with 
the DB s/w is called as JPA application.

JPA architecture:-
--------------------






Entity class or persistence class:-
--------------------------------------

--if we are using the annotaion, then we need not map this class with the table inside the xml mapping file.

--an Entity class or persistence class is a java class that is developed corresponding to a table of DB.  

--this class has many instance variables should be there as same as columns in teh corresponding table

--we should take Entity class as a POJO class.

--we need to provide mapping information with the table in this class only using annotaitons.

Note:- when we gives this persistance /Entity class obj to the ORM s/w, then ORM s/w will 
decide the destination DB s/w based on the configuration done in a xml file which is called as hibernate-configuration file.


Configuration file:-
-----------------------

--it is an xml file its name is "persistence.xml".

--this file must be created under src/META-INF folder in normal java application, 
where as in maven or gradle based application this file should be inside the src/main/resources/META-INF folder


--this file content will be used by ORM s/w (ORM engine) to locate the destination DB s/w.

--in this file generally 3 types of details we specify:-

1.DB connection details

2.ORM specific details (some instruction to the ORM s/w like dialect info,show_sql ,etc)

3. annotation based entity/persistence class name.

Note:- generally we take this file 1 per DB basis.

--we should always create this configuration file by taking support of example applications inside 
the project folder of hibernate download zip file or by taking the reffernce from the Google.
ex:-

persistence.xml:-
--------------------

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<persistence xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence"
             xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
             xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_2_0.xsd"
             version="2.0">


    <persistence-unit name="studentUnit" >

	<class>com.ratan.Student</class>        

<properties>
         
           <property name="javax.persistence.jdbc.driver" value="com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver" />
          <property name="javax.persistence.jdbc.url" value="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/ratandb" />
            <property name="javax.persistence.jdbc.user" value="root" />
            <property name="javax.persistence.jdbc.password" value="root" />
          
   
        </properties>
    </persistence-unit>
</persistence>



the root tag is :-

<persistence> with some xml-namespace 

--the child tag of <persistence> tag is <persistence-unit>

--this <persistence-unit> has 2 child tags:-

1. <class> tag ,:-using which we specify the Entity class name(fully qualified name) that used 
annotations to map a table

2.<properties> tag :- using this tag,we specify some configuration details to the ORM s/w


Persistence-unit:- it is a collection of Entity/Persistence class instance reffered by a unique 
user-defiend name


ORM engine :- 
-----------------

--it is a specialized s/w written in java that performs translation of jpa calls into the sql call by using mapping annotation and configuration
 file details and send the mapped sql to the DB s/w using JDBC.

--ORM engine is provided by any ORM s/w.

steps to devlop the JPA application:-
--------------------------------------------

1.create a maven project and add the hibernate-core dependency to the pom.xml.

2.add jdbc driver related dependency to the pom.xml

3.create a folder called "META-INF" inside src/main/resources folder, and create the "persistence.xml" file inside this folder
 by taking reference from Hibernate docs or from google.

step 4:- create as many  Entity/Perssitence  classes  as there r tables in the DB, apply the at least 2 annotations to these classes 


@Entity :- on the top of the class
@Id  :- on the top of PK mapped variable

--if we apply above 2 annotations then our java bean class will become Entity or Persistence class.

--inside these classes , we need to take variable corresponding to the columns of the tables.


step 5:- create a client application and activate ORM engine by using JPA api related following classes and interface and perform the DB operations.

1.Persistence class 

2.EntityManagerFactory

3.EntityManager


--if we use Hibernate core api then we need to use 

Configuration class

SessionFactory(I)

Session(I)





Note:- when we call createEntityManagerFactory(-) method by suppliying persistence-unit name 
on the Persistence class,we will get the EntityManagerFactory object.

--this method loads the "persistence.xml" file into the memory

--EntityManagerFactory obj should be only one per application per DB.

this EMF obj contains :-

connection pool,

some meta information

--by using this EMF class only we create the EntityManager object.

EntityManager em= emf.createEntityManager();
 
Note:- inside every DAO method we need to get the EntityManager obj


JPA application ----------------->EntityManager --------------------->ORM engine ------>JDBC------------>DB s/w


--in order to perform any DML (insert update delete ) the method calls should be in a transactional area.


 em.getTransaction(); method return "javax.persistice.EntityTransaction(I) " object.

this EntityTransaction obj is a singleton object, i.e per EntityManager obj, only one Transaction object is created.

--to store the object we need to call persist(-) method on the EM object.

--to get the Object from the DB we need to call :- find(--) method of EM object

this find(--) method takes 2 parameter 

1.the Classname of the Object which we want,

2.the ID value for which we want the object.


ex:-


Main.java:- for Read object
--------------
public class Main {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		EntityManagerFactory emf=Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("studentUnit");
		
		EntityManager em= emf.createEntityManager();
		
		Student s= em.find(Student.class, 60);
	
		if(s != null)
			System.out.println(s);
		else
			System.out.println("Student does not exit..");
		 
		em.close();
		
	}

}


Main.java :-(insert object)
------------------------------


public class Main {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		EntityManagerFactory emf=Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("studentUnit");
		
		EntityManager em= emf.createEntityManager();
		
		Student s = new Student(35, "Arun", 780);
		
	/*	EntityTransaction et= em.getTransaction();
		
		et.begin();
		
		em.persist(s);
		
		et.commit();
	*/	
	
		em.getTransaction().begin();
		
		em.persist(s);
		
		em.getTransaction().commit();
		
		em.close();
		
		System.out.println("done");
		
		
	}

}

Main.java:- Delete:-
-------------------------


public class Main {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		EntityManagerFactory emf=Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("studentUnit");
		
		EntityManager em= emf.createEntityManager();
		
	
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		
		System.out.println("Enter roll to delete ");
		int roll=sc.nextInt();
		
		Student student= em.find(Student.class, roll);
		
		if(student != null){
			
			em.getTransaction().begin();
			
			em.remove(student);
			
			em.getTransaction().commit();
			
			
			System.out.println("Student removed....");
			
		}else
			System.out.println("Student not found...");
		
		em.close();
		
		
		System.out.println("done");
		
		
	}

}


Main.java :- Update the marks:-
===========================



public class Main {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		EntityManagerFactory emf=Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("studentUnit");
		
		EntityManager em= emf.createEntityManager();
		
	
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		
		System.out.println("Enter roll to give grace marks ");
		int roll=sc.nextInt();
		
		Student student=em.find(Student.class, roll); //if it returns the obj then the obj will be in p.state
		
		
		if(student == null){
			System.out.println("Student does not exist..");
		}
		else
		{
			
			System.out.println("Enter the grace marks");
			int marks=sc.nextInt();
			
			em.getTransaction().begin();
			
			student.setMarks(student.getMarks()+marks);
			
			em.getTransaction().commit();
			
			System.out.println("Marks is graced...");
			
		}
		em.close();
	
		System.out.println("done");
		
		
	}

}


--in the above application we didn't call any update method, we just change the state of the persistence/entity  obj
inside the transactional area, at the end of the tx , ORM engine will generate the update sql.

--this is known as the ORM s/w maintaining synchronization bt entity obj and the db table records.

--we have a method called merge() inside the EntityManager obj to update a record also.



Life-cycle of persistence/entity object:-
-----------------------------------------------

an entity has the 3 life-cycle state:-

1.new state/transient state

2.persistence state/managed state

3.detached state


1.new state/transient state:- 
------------------------------------

--if we create a object of persistence class and this class is not attached with the EM obj, then
this stage is known as new state/transient state

Student s=new Student(10,"ram",780);


2.persistence state:- 
-------------------------

--if a persistence class obj is associated with EM obj, then this obj will be in persistence state.

ex:-

when we call a persist(-) method by supplying Student entity obj then at time student obj will be in persistence state

or 

when we call find() method and this method returns the Student obj, then that obj will also be in persistence state.

Note:- when an entity class obj is in persisitence state ,it is in-sync with the DB table ,i.e 
any change made on that obj inside the tx area will reflect to the table automatically.


ex:-



		Student s=new Student(150,"manoj",850); // here student obj is in transient state .
		
		em.getTransaction().begin();
		
		em.persist(s); // here it is in the persistence state
		
		s.setMarks(900);
		
		
		em.getTransaction().commit();
		

detached state:-
-------------------

--when we call  close() method   or call clear() method on the EM obj, then all the associated entity obj will be in detached state.

--in this stage the entity objs will not be in-sync with the table.



Note:- we have a merge() method in EM obj, when we call this method by supplying any detached object then that detaced object will bring back in the persistence state.



ex:-


Main.java:-
-------------


public class Main {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		EntityManagerFactory emf=Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("studentUnit");
		
		EntityManager em= emf.createEntityManager();
		
		Student s= em.find(Student.class, 20); //persistence state
		
		em.clear(); //detached state
		
		em.getTransaction().begin();
		
		s.setMarks(500);
	
		//em.persist(s);// it will throw duplicate ID related exception
		em.merge(s); //persistence state
	
		em.getTransaction().commit();
		
	
		System.out.println("done");	
	}
}


em.persist()
em.find()------------>persistence state-----------em.close(), em.clear()--------->detached state---->em.merge()--->persistence state




Note:- to see the ORM tool(HB) generated sql queries on the console add the following property inside the persistence.xml

  <property name="hibernate.show_sql"  value="true"/>


         

to create or update the table according to the entity class mapping information:-

   <property name="hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto"  value="create"/>
                   
create :- drop the existing table then create a fresh new table and insert the record.

update :- if table is not there then create a new table, and if table is already there it will perform insert operation only in the existing table.


           

some of the annotations of JPA:-
------------------------------------

@Entity :- to make a java bean class as entity , i.e to map with a table

@Id :- to make a field as the ID field (to map with PK of a table)

@Table(name="mystudents") :- if the table name and the class name is different

@Column(name="sname") :- if the column name of table and corresponding variable of the class is diff.


Generators in JPA:-
----------------------


	@Id
	@GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.AUTO)
	private int roll;


--here roll will be generated automatically for each row.

Note:- if we use this @GeneratedValue annoation then we are not allowed to give the roll explicitly while inserting a record.

AUTO :- internally underlaying ORM s/w creates a secquence or a table called "hibernate_sequence" to maintain the Id value.

IDENTITY :- it is used for auto_increatement feature to auto generate the id value

SEQUENCE :- it is used for sequence feature to auto generate the id value
