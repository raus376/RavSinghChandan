Maven : 
=======
(managing automated vehicle enhancing network)
--it is a build tool..

--it is a project management tool.

java project:
--------------

1.write source code.

2.add external jar files to the classpath.  50 jar 

3.compile the code.

4.prepare test case, compile the test cases, run the test cases.

--arrange all the codes in a diff folders 

src 
  ---
test
  ---
webapp
  html. js, image, jsp, 


5.prepare the test and code analysis report.

6.build the jar file, war file, ear file to bundle the application.

7.deploy to the server.


--the above process is known as build process.

--manually doing this build process will increase the burden on the developers.

--to automate build process of java app, Apache foundation has released a tool called

ANT (another neat tool)

the problem with the ANT are:

1. ANT tool does not have the capability to download the jar files automatically.

2.it can not compile and run the test cases automatically.

3.in ANT we need to write a big xml file called build.xml to instruct all the activities.

Maven : Apache foundation

1.we can use maven by using command prompt (without IDE)

2. using maven with IDE 

                                       
Maven terminology:
-------------------------

1. artifact :-

--An artifact is an outcome in maven, it can be a file, .class file or a jar file, war file,ear file,etc.

2. archetype:-

--it is project template for creating similar type of project in maven.

3. Groupid: 

--it is an Id used to identify the artifacts of a perticular organization (naming convention is similar to package name.) com.masai.

4.artiactid : it is the id for the final outcome (artifactid name will be the root folder of our application)

5.pom.xml :  (project object model) : all the information will be their in this file.

it defines following properties for a project:

1. Name
2.version

3. packaging (jar, war, ear)

4.dependecnies : required jar files.

5.plugins: will inhance the functionality of our project.

docker 
jenkins 


Maven Repository:
================

-- a repository is a store where maven maintains plugins, archetypes, and lots of jar files used for building different kinds of java projects.

maven repo are of 3 types:

1.central repo :- it is the maven's own repo in which it maintains all kinds of project related plugins, archetypes, jars etc.

https://repo1.maven.org/maven2

2.remote repo : this repo is maintained within the organization for sharing plugins, archetypes and jar files for multiple projects withing orgnizations.



3.local repo: this repo will be created inside the developer computer.  (.m2) is the name for this repo.
 


mysql-connector.jar


pom.xml:

.m2 --- 

maven build life cycle:
==================

maven build life cycle contains diff phases:


1. validate: - in this phase it will verify the project diectory structure is valid or not. and it has pom.xml file is there or not.

2.compile: maven compiles all the source code of the project by downloading and adding requied jar files in the classpath.

3.test-compile: if we have written any unit test cases those code will be compiled.

4.test : maven will run all the test cases and it will show how many test cases are success and how many fails.

5.package : maven will bundle our java code into a jar file inside 'target' folder.

6.install : that jar file in step 5 will be stored in the localrepo.

7.deploy : maven stores the application jar file to the central repo.

8.clean : here maven will delete and remove all the files that are generated in previous build.


Note: if we execute any phase to build the maven project then maven will execute all the phases till that given phase.

mvn clean



src/main/java  : -- here we need to place our source code

src/main/resources : any xml file, properties files, text files


src/test/java  : -- here we need to place our source code to unit testing

src/test/resources : any xml file, properties files, text files to unit testing


after creating a maven project we need to change the java  version of the maven project from jdk 5 to jdk 8


 <properties>
    <maven.compiler.source>1.8</maven.compiler.source>
    <maven.compiler.target>1.8</maven.compiler.target>
  </properties>


after pasting the above tag inside the pom.xml file we need to update our maven project:

right click on the project--->maven ---> update maven project.













Layared Architecture in Business application:-
====================================


1.storing the business data in secure and easily retrival manner. (DB )

--the logic that we write to implement this part of business application is known as data accees logic.

2.processing the data according to the business rule .

--the logic that we write to implement this part of business application is known as business/service logic.

3.presenting the data to the user in user-understandable format.

--the logic that we write to implement this part of business application is known as presentation logic.


--the above 3 logics is required for almost every business application.


Note:- we can write all the 3 logics to develop a business application in one program/class itself ,
 if we do so, the following problem we will face:-



1.all the logics to develop the application will be mixed up with each other (no clear code seperation).

2.modification done in one logic may affect the other logic .

3. logics will depend upon each other so, parellal developement will not be possible.

4.testing each logic is also will become complex..


--to solve this problem,  a java based business application ,we devide into 3 logical partition .

and each part we say as a layer:-

1.Presentation Layer(UI layer)

2.Business Logic Layer (Service layer)

3.Data Access Layer 


--a bussiness application will be devided into the logical partition depending upon the role played by each part.

--logical partition of a business application is known as layer.




Presentation Layer :- 
-----------------------

--it is set of java classes, which are responsible for generating user input screen and response page(output screen) is knwon as PL.

--this layer provides the intraction with the end-user.


Business Logic Layer/Service Layer:-
------------------------------------------

--programatical implementation of business rule of a business organization is nothing but business logic .
--a collection of java classes whose methods have business logic to process the data according to the business rule is known as SL/BLL.


Data Access Layer :-
------------------------

--a set of java classes whose methods  exclusivly meant for performing CRUD operation with the DB server is known as DAL.
